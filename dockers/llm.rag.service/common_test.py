## Your task:
Dear [Colleague's Name],
I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to discuss an important aspect of our version control practices, specifically regarding the integration of changes from feature branches into our main branch.
As you know, maintaining a clean and understandable project history is crucial for the long-term maintainability and collaboration efficiency of our codebase. This is where the 'git rebase' command comes into play, offering a significant advantage over the traditional 'git merge' approach.
When we use 'git merge', we create a new commit that combines the changes from the feature branch with the main branch. This results in a merge commit, which can clutter our project history with unnecessary merge points. Over time, as we continue to merge feature branches, our history can become a tangled web of commits, making it difficult to track the
